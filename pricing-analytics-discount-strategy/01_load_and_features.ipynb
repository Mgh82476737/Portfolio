    "This project focuses on analysing pricing, discounting, and profitability patterns using a real-world retail dataset.  \n",
    "The goal is to understand how discounts, pricing decisions, and operational factors impact profit outcomes, while explicitly addressing data quality limitations and business constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Objectives\n",
    "- Analyse the impact of discounts on revenue and profit\n",
    "- Identify loss-making orders and products\n",
    "- Build transparent, decision-ready features for downstream SQL and Power BI analysis\n",
    "- Document all data quality issues and analytical assumptions\n"

    "### Business Context\n",
    "Despite strong sales performance, retail businesses often struggle with inconsistent profitability.  \n",
    "High revenue does not necessarily translate into healthy margins, especially when discounts are applied without clear rules or evidence-based evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project is framed around a common business concern:\n",
    "**Are discounts genuinely driving profitable growth, or are they masking underlying pricing and cost issues?**\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Business Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q1. Sales vs Profit Alignment\n",
    "Where do sales and profit diverge across products, categories, regions, and customer segments?  \n",
    "Which areas generate high revenue but consistently erode profit?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q2. Discount Impact on Profitability\n",
    "How do different discount levels affect profit and sales volume?  \n",
    "At what point does discounting become harmful rather than beneficial?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q3. Decision-Oriented Pricing Rules\n",
    "Based on historical data, what practical discount and pricing rules can be defined to reduce loss-making orders and improve margin stability?\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analytical Focus\n",
    "The analysis prioritises **decision-making insight** over descriptive reporting.  \n",
    "Each question is designed to lead to a clear business action rather than a standalone metric.\n"

    "Profitability declines as discount levels increase.\n",
    "Low or zero discount orders show higher average profit and profit margin,\n",
    "while higher discount buckets exhibit a sharp increase in loss rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Orders with discounts above 30 percent are disproportionately loss-making,\n",
    "indicating that discounting at these levels often fails to generate\n",

    "discount strategies rather than data quality issues.\n",

    "\n",
    "The initial loss ranking showed a small number of products with very large total losses,\n",
    "sometimes driven by only one or two loss-making orders.\n",
    "At first glance, this raised concerns about potential calculation issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "A closer inspection revealed that this behaviour was not caused by aggregation errors,\n",
    "but by a known data quality limitation identified earlier during data assessment.\n",
    "Approximately 5 percent of records contain missing sales values while still reporting profit and discount.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because unit economics and relative profitability cannot be reliably evaluated without sales,\n",
    "these records were excluded from pricing-focused analysis rather than being removed entirely.\n",
    "\n",
    "After filtering to loss-making orders with valid sales values only,\n",
    "a second pattern became clear.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even after removing the affected records, several products still exhibit\n",
    "severe losses driven by a small number of very large orders combined with aggressive discounting.\n",
    "This indicates that order size and ticket value play a critical role in loss magnitude,\n",
    "and that a single heavily discounted high-value order can dominate total loss figures.\n",
    "\n",
    "This insight motivated the shift from absolute loss analysis\n",
    "to normalised metrics such as profit margin,\n",
    "allowing structurally loss-making products to be distinguished\n",
