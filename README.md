# Applied Data Scientist | Analytics & Predictive Modelling

I am an applied data scientist focused on turning messy, real world data
into clear, decision ready insights.

My work sits at the intersection of data analytics, predictive modelling,
and business problem solving, with hands on experience using Python, SQL,
Power BI, and applied machine learning techniques.

This portfolio presents a small number of carefully selected projects
that are directly aligned with my CV and represent my strongest end to end work.

## What This Portfolio Contains

This repository is intentionally minimal.

It includes only featured projects that demonstrate:

- Real world data handling and problem framing  
- Strong analytical thinking and decision driven modelling  
- Clean, well documented, production oriented solutions  
- Business focused insights rather than academic exercises  

All exploratory work, experiments, and learning projects
are maintained separately in a dedicated lab repository.
