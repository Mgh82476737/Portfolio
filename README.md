# Applied Data Scientist | Analytics & Predictive Modelling

I am an applied data scientist focused on turning messy, real world data
into clear, decision ready insights.

My work sits at the intersection of data analytics, predictive modelling,
and business problem solving, with hands on experience using Python, SQL,
Power BI, and applied machine learning techniques.

This portfolio presents a small number of carefully selected projects
that are directly aligned with my CV and represent my strongest end to end work.

## What This Portfolio Contains

This repository is intentionally minimal.

It includes only featured projects that demonstrate:

- Real world data handling and problem framing  
- Strong analytical thinking and decision driven modelling  
- Clean, well documented, production oriented solutions  
- Business focused insights rather than academic exercises  

All exploratory work, experiments, and learning projects
are maintained separately in a dedicated lab repository.

## Featured Projects

### 1. Liquidity Risk and Cash Buffer Analysis

Decision focused analytics project analysing historical cash balance dynamics to assess downside liquidity risk, cash buffer resilience, and stress conditions.
The project uses drawdown based risk modelling to convert raw transactional cash flows into practical liquidity risk signals (Safe, Caution, Critical) for management decision making.

**Focus:**  Liquidity risk, downside analysis, decision support
**Tools:**  Python, SQL, pandas
🔗 Project: liquidity-risk-cash-buffer

### 2. Pricing Analytics and Discount Strategy
Pricing analytics project analysing the impact of discounting on profitability,
identifying loss making products, and simulating pricing governance rules
to support managerial decision making.

**Focus:** Pricing analytics, profitability analysis, scenario simulation  
**Tools:** Python, pandas, numpy
