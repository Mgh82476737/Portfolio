# Applied Data Scientist | Analytics & Predictive Modelling

I am an applied data scientist with a strong focus on turning messy, real world data into clear, decision ready insights.

My work sits at the intersection of data analytics, predictive modelling, and business problem solving, with hands on experience using Python, SQL, Power BI, and machine learning techniques.

This portfolio showcases a small number of carefully selected projects that are directly aligned with my CV and represent my strongest, end to end work.

## What this portfolio contains

This repository is intentionally minimal.

It includes only featured projects that demonstrate:
• real world data handling
• analytical thinking and problem framing
• clean, well documented solutions
• business focused insights rather than academic exercises

All exploratory work, experiments, and learning projects are maintained separately in a dedicated lab repository.
